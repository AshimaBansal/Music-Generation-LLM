# 🎯 IMPLEMENTATION READY - TODO List Created

## What's Ready

I've created a comprehensive **35-step TODO list** breaking down the entire implementation into manageable chunks.

---

## 📋 The TODO List

**Location**: `IMPLEMENTATION_TODO.md`

**Structure**: 7 phases, 35 actionable steps

```
Phase 1: Create Module        [7 steps]    - Create notation module
Phase 2: Update CLI          [6 steps]    - Update command-line interface  
Phase 3: Infrastructure      [3 steps]    - Docker and dependencies
Phase 4: Create Tests        [8 steps]    - Comprehensive testing
Phase 5: Documentation       [2 steps]    - Update docs
Phase 6: Verification        [8 steps]    - Quality assurance
Phase 7: Finalization        [1 step]     - Clean up and deploy

TOTAL: 35 steps | Effort: 5-6 hours
```

## 📊 Progress Tracking

All steps start as "TODO" ⬜

As you complete each step, I'll update them to "IN PROGRESS" ⏳ and then "DONE" ✅

---

## 🚀 Let's Start

### **I'm ready to begin Step 1:**

**Step 1: Create directory structure**

```bash
# What to do:
mkdir -p processing/notation
touch processing/notation/__init__.py
touch processing/notation/sheet_music.py
touch processing/notation/constants.py
```

### **Should I generate the code for Step 1?**

**YES** → I'll create the complete implementation for Step 1

OR

**NO** → Tell me what you'd like adjusted first

---

## 📌 How This Works

1. **I generate code for one step**
2. **You review and integrate** into your project
3. **You test and confirm** it works
4. **We move to next step** once current is complete
5. **Repeat** until all 35 steps done

**Benefits**:
✅ Easy to review small changes
✅ Easy to test incrementally  
✅ Easy to debug if issues
✅ Learn the codebase as we build
✅ Full control at each step

## 🎬 Ready to Start?

### **Tell me:**
1. Should I start with **Step 1** (create directory)?
2. Or should I **jump to Step 3** (json_to_music21_score function)?
3. Or do you want **ALL code at once** for Phase 1?

### **Then I'll generate:**
- Complete, working code
- With full error handling
- With proper type hints
- With clear comments
- Ready to integrate

## 📚 Reference Documents

While we code, keep these open:
- **QUICK_REFERENCE_CHANGES.md** - Exact code locations
- **IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md** - Detailed guidance
- **IMPLEMENTATION_TODO.md** - This step list

---

## ✨ You're All Set!

**Everything is planned. Code is ready to be written. Tests are designed. Documentation is prepared.**

**What's your preference?**

A) Start with Step 1 (create directory structure)
B) Start with Step 3 (main conversion function) 
C) Generate all Phase 1 code (7 steps) at once
D) Something else?

**Let me know and I'll generate the code immediately!** 🎼
